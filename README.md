# Hackathon-Financial-Portal-

This app was selected as the #1 winning app of the MecSimCalc Hackathon 4.0. It was designed in Python using the MecSimCalc platform and editor.

Beware, you cannot run this app on your own editor because the code is tweaked specifically to run on MecSimCalc's python editor. 

This calculator is designed to allow you to view your plan your monthly expenses, set savings goals, and understand the power of compound interest through a series of user inputs.
